                <p>
                    <em>Hello, I'm Carmen,</em> a dedicated student and aspiring <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> designer committed to transforming user challenges into seamless experiences at scale. With a background in hospitality, I've built strong communication skills, an excellent work ethic, and a positive can-do attitude. I'm empathetic, team-oriented, user-focused, and results-driven. I've successfully tackled projects ranging from commerce systems to web applications.

                <p>
                    My journey into <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> design started after earning my first college diploma in business management while helping manage my family business that is now celebrating it's 35<sup>th</sup> year anniversary. Initially geared towards taking over the family business, my time there sparked a passion for digital design. This ignited my path toward UX. This unique blend of hands-on experience and formal education equips me with a holistic perspective and a genuine passion for creating meaningful user experiences.
